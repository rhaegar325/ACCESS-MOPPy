ACCESS-MOPPy Documentation
===========================

ACCESS-MOPPy (Model Output Post-Processor)
-------------------------------------------------

ACCESS-MOPPy is a CMORisation tool designed to post-process ACCESS model output. This version represents a significant rewrite of the original MOPPy, focusing on usability and flexibility. It introduces a user-friendly Python API that can be integrated into Jupyter notebooks and other workflows.

ACCESS-MOPPy allows for targeted CMORisation of individual variables and is specifically designed to support the ACCESS-ESM1.6 configuration prepared for CMIP7 FastTrack. Ocean variable support remains limited in this alpha release.

**Key Features**
- Improved usability and extensibility
- Python API for integration into notebooks and scripts
- **Enhanced variable mapping display with rich Jupyter notebook interface**
- Flexible CMORisation of specific variables
- Tailored for ACCESS-ESM1.6 and CMIP7 FastTrack
- Cross-platform compatibility (not limited to NCI Gadi)
- Dask-enabled for scalable processing
- **Batch processing system for HPC environments**
- **Real-time monitoring with web dashboard**

**Current Limitations**
- Alpha version: intended for evaluation only, not recommended for data publication
- Ocean variable support is limited

> **⚠️ Variable Mapping Under Review**
>
> The mapping of ACCESS variables to CMIP6 and CMIP7 equivalents is under review. Some derived variables may not be available or may require further verification. Please submit an issue if you notice any major problems or missing variables.

**Background**

ACCESS-MOPPy is a complete rewrite of the original APP4 and MOPPeR frameworks. Unlike previous versions, it does **not** depend on CMOR; instead, it leverages modern Python libraries such as **xarray** and **dask** for efficient processing of NetCDF files. This approach streamlines the workflow, improves flexibility, and enhances integration with contemporary data science tools.

While retaining the core concepts of "custom" and "cmip" modes, ACCESS-MOPPy unifies these workflows within a single configuration file, focusing on usability and extensibility for current and future CMIP projects.
